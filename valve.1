.SH BUGS
.B valve
works best with European Philips/Mullard designations (like ECC83) or
American R.E.T.M.A. designations for which
.B valve
knows a Philips/Mullard equivalent (like 12AX7). It can tell very
little from R.E.T.M.A. names alone, and nothing at all from valve
designations that don't follow either scheme.

.B valve
will sometimes mis-identify valves that don't use either of the two
naming schemes mentioned (for example the KT66, which looks like
Philips/Mullard to
.B valve
but isn't).

.B valve
hasn't been hipped yet to some very obscure valve sockets
(Philips/Mullard names that end in more than two digits) or to
inverted names (like E83CC).
